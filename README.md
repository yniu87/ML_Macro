# Modeling Macroeconomic Dynamics with Deep Learning
Machine Learning in Macroeconomics 

We leverage Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to approximate partial differential equations (PDEs), which represent macroeconomic dynamics. We first solve a baseline model in one dimension. We compare our solutions from deep learning with existing results from the literature in order to establish mathematical correctness and macroeconomic modeling capability. Then, we extend the baseline model with an additional input and a diffusion process. This algorithm complements traditional numerical techniques (\emph{e.g.} finite difference method) and can be easily scaled to higher dimensions.
