We leverage Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to approximate partial differential equations (PDEs), which represent macroeconomic dynamics. A temporal difference(TD) learning approach is adopted. We first solve a baseline Neoclassical Growth (NCG) model in one dimension. We compare our solutions from deep learning with existing results from the literature for numerical accuracy. Then, we extend the baseline NCG model with an additional input (productivity shock) and a diffusion process. This algorithm complements traditional numerical techniques (\emph{e.g.} finite difference method) and can be easily scaled to higher dimensions.
